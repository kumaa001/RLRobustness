# RLRobustness
The code in this repository corresponds to the paper Recovering Robustness in Model-Free Reinforcement learning in Arxiv.
The root for the folder structure has the code which solves for the Doyle's example and Moore's example using simple Random search based optimization technique. 

This paper in v3 has been revised to include policy gradient ascent based method instead of simple random search, to improve the execution time. The new code along with the example specific functions have been grouped together into two folders Doyle, Moore respepectively. The Doyle's example simulation from section I,II,III and all its necessary files including the data.mat have been grouped together in the Doyle folder. Moore's example from section IV and its files and data.mat have been grouped together in the Moore folder.
